				<h3>Surviving your campervan adventure</h3>
				<img src="application/images/camper-van.jpg"/>
				<p class="blog-summary">Living in a campervan is either your idea of heaven or your idea of hell. If you’re on the heaven side of the camp you’ll be thinking about the freedom to go wherever you want, whenever you want. You’ll be imagining camping on beaches and gathering around a campfire while drinking beers under the stars. If living in a campervan would be your idea of hell then you’re probably thinking of the cramped spaces, having to make a bathroom out of a bush and the many, many hours driving. And when The Boy and I drove around Australia in our campervan, there was A LOT of driving! Living in a campervan was by far the best experience of my life but there were times when it wasn’t easy. After a whole year of it, my boyfriend and I came up with a few tips to make it easier:</p>

				<p class="blog-full" id="blog-one"><strong>Embrace minimalism…then take it a step further</strong><br>
				To say there was very little room inside the campervan is the understatement of the century. I’ve always wanted to live with just the clothes on my back but if you do that in the real world, well, you’d be a tramp. Backpacking is probably the only exception.<br>		
				In some ways it was liberating to have so little and to never wake up thinking ‘I wonder what I should wear today…’<br>
				<strong>Make friends with someone who has a better van than you</strong><br>
				It doesn’t matter how good your campervan is, there’s always someone with a bigger and better one. Our van was a battered old VW with a mattress and a cupboard so it wasn’t difficult for us to find friends who met this criteria. People generally stick to similar routes when they’re backpacking so it’s easy enough to stick together.<br>
				We made friends with a group of guys who had that luxury item all backpackers want – a fridge. And what does a fridge mean? Cold beer. It was a very good friendship choice.<br>
				<strong>What to do when it rains</strong><br>
				Living in a campervan leads to a very outdoorsy lifestyle because it’s not like you can kickback in the living room to play computer games (unless you’re in one of those fancy pants campers like on Meet the Fockers). When it rains you’re left with very few options that don’t involve spending a fortune.<br>
				Of course you can go to a shopping mall, out for food, the cinema or bowling but this isn’t good for a backpacker’s budget.<br>
				We eventually came up with a weird but entertaining solution – go to the pet store.<br>
				In the US and Australia, pet stores aren’t like the ones in the UK that just have food and fish, these ones have kittens and puppies! Yes, you look like a complete weirdo (especially when you’re travelling with four guys in their late 20’s) but, you have to admit, it’s a great way to spend a rainy afternoon without spending a penny.<br>
				<strong>Always put your food in sealed containers</strong><br>
				We learnt this lesson the hard way and had a little mouse join us for part of the journey. I dread to think how long I was sharing my muesli with Stuart Little. We spent a few nights listening to him scurry around the roof space of the van before we finally caught him (and then realised how small and cute he was and felt terrible!)<br>
				<strong>Make sure you have air-con and the money to pay for it</strong><br>
				We bought our campervan based on the fact it had ‘Icy Cold Air-Con’ and when I say icy cold, I actually mean arctic standards that could lead to frost bite. It was delightful!<br>
				The only problem was than you could see the fuel gauge drop when the A/C was switched on. We had a few weeks when we were driving to a new job but had so little money that we had to turn it off and drive with wet towels hanging from the windows and around our necks. I honestly thought I was going to melt.<br>
				<strong>Stay in campsites whenever possible</strong><br>
				The thought of camping on the beach is all very romantic and it’s great for one or two nights a week but it won’t be long before you miss toilets, hot showers, cooking facilities and the company of other people.<br>
				One the west coast of Australia it was easy to go days without seeing anyone except in petrol stations so it’s good to get to a campsite where can chat to the locals and other travellers going in the opposite direction for some advice and insider’s tips.<br>
				But even as I’m writing this I can’t help but laugh. I think I’ll still be laughing at some of the stupid things that happened when I’m in my 80’s and I’ll know that it was all worth it and that it was the best year of my life.

				<h3>Most breathtaking waterfalls</h3>
				<img src="application/images/waterfall.jpg">
				<p class="blog-summary">“If there is magic on the planet, it is contained in water,” said famed American anthropologist, Loren Eiseley. No matter where in the world you are, you don’t have to venture very far to experience the magic of our planet’s most spectacular waterfalls. Many of these stunning falls are sprinkled throughout the world’s most striking destinations, adding even greater magic, mystery and magnificence to these natural wonders. From the plunging rapids in Hawaii and Iceland, to the horsetail drops in Chile, these impressive watercourses are fittingly considered to be among the more exotic waterfalls of distant lands. Whether you’re planning a week-long vacation, an afternoon of hiking, or you’re simply passing by, be sure to set aside some time to explore these hidden gems and 10 of the most breathtaking waterfalls in the world.</p>

				<p class="blog-full" id="blog-two">
					<strong>Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe</strong><br>
					The Victoria Falls or Mosi-oa-Tunya is a gorgeous waterfall, located on the Zambia and Zimbabwe border. The water of Zambezi river falls down in a straight line for 354 ft (108 m). It is wide ( 5,604 ft/1,708 m), therefore water spray raises very high and can be spotted from many kilometers away.<br>
					<strong>Iguazu Falls in Argentina</strong><br>
					Iguazu Falls are found on the border of Brazil and Argentina. Not very high (285 ft/87 m), but very impressive: it has 275 cascades, that form a horseshoe and stretch for 8858ft (2700 m).<br>
					<strong>Angel Falls in Venezuela</strong><br>
					Angel Falls is the highest in the world, which falls down uninterrupted for 3,212 ft (979 m). You can visit it in Canaima National Park, which is protected by UNESCO. It is named after its discoverer US aviator Jimmie Angel.<br>
					<strong>Kaieteur Falls in Guyana</strong><br>
					Kaieteur Falls is found in Guyana. Water falls for 741 ft (226 m), then it reaches the first of the many steep cascades. It attracts many tourists, who like extreme trips, since the fall is in the middle of a wilderness with no urban amenities.<br>
 					<strong>Niagara Falls in USA/Canada</strong><br>
					Niagara Falls is probably the most famous in the world. It marks US and Canada border. Niagara is formed of two sections – the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side and the American Falls on the American side – that are separated by an island. The Horseshoe Falls are more impressive: water here drops 173 ft (53 m), while the American Falls drop only 70–100 ft (21–30 m).<br>
					<strong>Gullfoss (Golden Falls) in Iceland</strong><br>
					Gullfoss is a magnificent waterfall located in southwest Iceland. Not particularly high (two 36 ft/11 m and 68 ft/21 m plunges), however, it is very beautiful. Due to a crevice, the river Hvítá seems to disappear into the abyss.<br>
					<strong>Plitvice Falls in Croatia</strong><br>
					Plitvice Falls are found in Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia. They are not very high falls, but are stunning due to the many cascades water has to overcome. There are hundreds of waterfalls. The color of water varies from from crystal clear to azure, to turquoise.<br>
					<strong>Yosemite Falls in USA</strong><br>
					Yosemite Falls is the highest waterfall in North America. It drops 2,425 ft (739 m) in the Sierra Nevada, California. The source of water is melting snow, therefore sometimes the stream may cease due to a little amount of snow.<br>
					<strong>Sutherland Falls in New Zealand</strong><br>
					Sutherland Falls are located in Fiordland, New Zealand. With its 1902 ft (580 m) plunge it is one of the tallest waterfall in the world. It falls in three cascades, that create this unique landscape. It was named after its discoverer Donald Sutherland in 1880.<br>
					<strong>Nohkalikai Falls in India</strong><br>
					Nohkalikai Falls is found in India. Water falls down for 1100 ft (335 m). Although the feeding stream is only 1,5 mi (2 km) long, Nohkalikai is still very impressive. A pool is formed below the fall, in which water receives green color.<br>
